// Switch Statement

// Syntax:

/* switch(expression) {
    case x:
      //* code block
      break;
    case y:
      //* code block
      break;
    default:
      //* code block
  } */


// The switch expression is evaluated once.
// The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
// If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
// If there is no match, the default code block is executed.
